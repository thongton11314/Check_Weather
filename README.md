# Check_Weather
This application will request input from user where they live (zipcode) then display the weather near by.

## Description
  The report will explain the WeatherRestAPI class. What kind of APIs are used,
  what external libraries are imported, the flowchart to demonstrate the logic behind
  implementation, and how to compile the source code.
## APIs Used
  WeatherRestAPI implements two different restful APIs.
  ● The first API is used from OpenWeatherMap. This API needs to be provided the
  city input to get the city’s weather information.
  ● The second API is used from GeoDB Cities. This API needs to be provided
  locations such as longitude and latitude input to get the cities nearby
